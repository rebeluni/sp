I cannot imagine a day without your text, night without your thought, you occupy 99% of my mind, 1% is shwarma. I know God is real because NO WAY HE SENT YOU DOWN ON EARTH six months before i was born, like how do you find the missing puzzle piece before the puzzle is even invented? 💝 Your Poem 💝\n\nnever did it ever cross my mind\nthat I'd love someone so kind\nbut at the sight of dogs, you whine\nYet, you somehow cease the time\n\nFor you search of menstrual pain reliefs on youtube\nWhen gym-burnout reliefs are the ones you need more\nAnd you adorn me with 200 bucks\nWhen 150 bucks are all you own\n\nWith you, ghodbunder road is a stairway to heaven\nAnd, without you, sea link is a purgatory\nI might graduate soon, but tell me\nHow does our 10 yard walk last for seconds\nWhile a trip next door breaks my ribs\n\nyou make mahindra seem closer to the college\nAnd you make buses seem less crowded\nAnd not because you occupy a 4 men-space\nBut because.. all I can see is you and your face\n\nThe doubts stop echoing in my head when you look at me\nAnd life feels like a cas album, or a 90s hollywood movie\nthis cup of coffee without sugar is always sweeter\nWith you seated right next to me :)\n  ",
